# EventsWebApp
Webpage for events using ASP.net core MVC
This is a webpage. I've worked on after my training in EFE
I've using ASP.net core MVC to builed it.
Don't look at the UI just worked in the BACK-END in this project.

note:
You may need to change the Connection, because it may give you an error.
